## Step 4: Organize with Smart Tags

SaveIt automatically suggests tags, but you can add your own:

### Auto-Generated Tags
Our AI analyzes content and suggests relevant tags:
```
Example: Saved "React Performance Guide"
Auto-tags: React, Performance, JavaScript, Frontend, Tutorial
```

### Custom Tags
Add personal tags that make sense to you:
- `#work-project` - For professional resources
- `#weekend-reading` - For leisure content  
- `#tutorial` - For learning materials
- `#inspiration` - For creative content

### Tag Best Practices
- **Use specific tags:** `react-hooks` instead of just `react`
- **Be consistent:** Always use the same tag format
- **Think about retrieval:** Tag based on how you'll search later

## Step 5: Search and Find Your Bookmarks

SaveIt's AI-powered search makes finding bookmarks effortless:

### Natural Language Search
Search the way you think:
- "That React tutorial from last week"
- "Design inspiration for mobile apps"
- "JavaScript performance articles"

### Traditional Search
Use specific terms:
- Search by **title**: "React Performance"
- Search by **tag**: `#tutorial`
- Search by **domain**: `medium.com`

### Filters
Narrow down results:
- **Date range**: "Last 30 days"
- **Content type**: Articles, videos, tools
- **Tags**: Filter by specific tags

## Step 6: Import Existing Bookmarks

Don't start from scratch! Import your existing bookmarks:

### From Chrome
1. **Export** bookmarks: Chrome → Bookmarks → Bookmark Manager → ⋮ → Export
2. **Import** to SaveIt: Dashboard → Settings → Import → Upload HTML file

### From Firefox  
1. **Export** bookmarks: Library → Bookmarks → Show All → Import and Backup → Export
2. **Import** to SaveIt: Upload the generated JSON file

### From Safari
