# SaveIt.now API

The SaveIt.now API allows you to programmatically manage your bookmarks and integrate SaveIt.now with your applications and workflows.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are available at:

```
https://saveit.now/api/v1
```

## Authentication

The API uses Bearer token authentication. You need to include your API key in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting an API Key

1. Navigate to your [API Keys page](/account/keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give your key a descriptive name
4. Copy the generated key (you won't be able to see it again)

### API Key Management

- API keys don't expire automatically but can be set to expire
- You can revoke API keys at any time
- Each key shows when it was last used
- Keys are linked to your account and have the same permissions as your user

## Rate Limiting

The API has rate limits to ensure fair usage:

- **Free accounts**: 100 requests per hour
- **Pro accounts**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise accounts**: 5000 requests per hour

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Response Format

All API responses are in JSON format. Successful responses include the requested data, while errors include an error message and details.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "BOOKMARK_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested bookmark was not found"
  }
}
```
