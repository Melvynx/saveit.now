When you save your bookmarks to SaveIt.now, you're trusting us with your digital life. We take that responsibility seriously.

## Your Data is Safe with Neon.tech

We store all your bookmarks in a PostgreSQL database hosted by Neon.tech. Why Neon? They're one of the most reliable database providers out there, and they handle security like the pros they are.

Your data gets encrypted both when it travels to our servers and when it sits in the database. Neon.tech also runs multiple backups automatically, so even if something catastrophic happens, your bookmarks are safe. These backups happen across different servers in secure data centers, which means your data has multiple safety nets.

## You Own Your Data, Always

Here's something important: your bookmarks belong to you, not us. You can export everything at any time. No questions asked, no hoops to jump through. Just go to your settings and download everything in JSON, CSV, or standard bookmark format.

We actually recommend doing this regularly. If you're someone who saves a lot of bookmarks daily, consider exporting your data every few days. Think of it like backing up your phone - it's one of those things you'll be grateful for if something goes wrong. Keep these exports somewhere safe on your computer or cloud storage.

## Open Source Means Nothing to Hide

SaveIt.now is open source, which means anyone can look at our code. This isn't just about being transparent - it's about proving that we do what we say we do. When our code is public, security researchers and developers can spot problems and help us fix them.

You can even run your own version of SaveIt.now if you want complete control. Host it on your own servers, modify it however you like. The open source version might not have all the latest features we roll out on the hosted version, but it gives you total independence.

## Privacy That Actually Means Something

We don't sell your data. Period. We don't have advertising, so we don't need to track you or build profiles for advertisers. Our business model is simple: you pay for the service, and we keep it running well.

We only collect the data we need to make SaveIt.now work. That means your bookmarks, your account info, and basic usage data to help us improve the service. We don't dig through your bookmarks for marketing insights or sell lists of "people who bookmark tech articles" to third parties.

If you want to see everything we have about you, just ask. Want to delete your account completely? That's your right, and we'll make sure everything gets wiped properly.

## When Things Go Wrong

Nobody's perfect, and if we ever have a security issue, we'll tell you about it quickly and honestly. We have processes in place to respond to problems fast, and we believe in being transparent about what happened and what we're doing to fix it.

We also learn from these situations to make sure they don't happen again. Security isn't a destination - it's an ongoing process of getting better.

## Why This Matters

In a world where your data gets sold, tracked, and exploited, we're trying to build something different. SaveIt.now exists because we believe you should be able to save and organize your bookmarks without worrying about what's happening to your data behind the scenes.

Your bookmarks are yours. They should stay that way.
