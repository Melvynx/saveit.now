In SaveIt.now, the only things you need to import your bookmarks is the **link**.

For this, you can import a `.html`, a `.csv` or any other file that contains your bookmarks.

## Importing from Chrome

In Chrome, you can export your bookmarks to a `.html` file.

Go to [bookmark page](chrome://bookmarks/?id=2) and then click on the three dots in the top right corner and select "Export bookmarks".

Finally, you can go to [SaveIt.now](https://saveit.now/import) and drag-n-drop this file inside the import section.
