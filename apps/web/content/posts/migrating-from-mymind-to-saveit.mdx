MyMind's beautiful interface caught your eye, but its limitations are holding you back. Limited AI capabilities, no API access, and a $12/month price tag for basic functionality.

## Why Users are Leaving MyMind for SaveIt.now

Before we dive into the migration process, here's why thousands of MyMind users have already made the switch:

### The MyMind Reality Check

- **Basic AI Search**: The results is often not relevant
- **Premium pricing**: $12/month for features other tools include for free
- **Export limitations**: Difficult to get your data out

### The SaveIt.now Advantage
- **Advanced AI**: Deep content analysis and semantic search (learn more about [AI bookmark management trends](/posts/ai-bookmark-management-trends-2024))
- **Multi-format support**: YouTube, PDFs, X posts, not just images
- **Better pricing**: $5/month for more features (see all options in our [complete bookmark manager guide](/posts/best-bookmark-managers-2024-complete-guide))
- **Migration friendly**: Easy import and data enhancement

## Pre-Migration Checklist

Before starting your migration, ensure you have:

✅ **MyMind account access** (active subscription required for export)
✅ **Desktop computer** with Chrome or Edge browser
✅ **Stable internet connection** for the export process
✅ **Time allocation**: 30-60 minutes depending on collection size
✅ **SaveIt.now account** (create your free account first)

## Part 1: Exporting Your Data from MyMind

### Step 1: Access MyMind Export Function

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome or Edge required)
   - MyMind's export only works with latest Chrome or Microsoft Edge
   - Mobile export is not supported

2. **Navigate to MyMind settings**
   - Go to [access.mymind.com](https://access.mymind.com)
   - Click the **cog icon** in the left corner of your mind interface

3. **Locate the export option**
   - Scroll to the bottom right corner of the Account page
   - Click **"Export my mind"**

### Step 2: Understanding MyMind Export Limitations

**Important**: MyMind's export has significant limitations you should know about:

- **No re-import**: MyMind doesn't support importing data back, so this is a one-way migration
- **Browser restrictions**: Only works on desktop Chrome/Edge browsers
- **Limited format**: Exports as individual files + CSV, not URL lists
- **No metadata**: Tags and organization structure may not transfer perfectly

### Step 3: Complete the Export Process

1. **Select your download folder**
   - Choose a dedicated folder for your MyMind export
   - Ensure you have sufficient storage space

2. **Wait for download completion**
   - MyMind will save individual files (images, PDFs) to your folder
   - You'll also receive a "cards.csv" file with text-based content
   - Large collections may take several minutes

3. **Verify your export**
   - Check that all files downloaded successfully
   - Open the cards.csv file to review your text content
   - Note any missing or corrupted files

## Part 2: Preparing Your Data for SaveIt.now

### Step 4: Organize Your Exported Data

**Review the CSV file**:
The "cards.csv" contains:
- Notes and text content
- Bookmark URLs
- Quotes and highlights
- Basic metadata

**Extract URLs for migration**:
1. Open the cards.csv file in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Filter for rows containing URLs
3. Create a clean list of URLs to import into SaveIt.now
4. Note any important context or tags for manual addition later

### Step 5: Prepare Additional Content

**For images and PDFs**:
- MyMind exports these as individual files
- You'll need to manually upload important ones to SaveIt.now
- SaveIt.now will enhance them with AI analysis

**For notes and quotes**:
- Consider which standalone notes are worth preserving
- You can add these manually or as text notes in SaveIt.now
