## Common Migration Questions

Your collection structure exports as metadata. SaveIt.now's AI will suggest improved organization based on content analysis, often working better than manual categorization.

SaveIt.now uses semantic search that understands content meaning. Search for "database performance tips" and find relevant content even if it's titled "MySQL Optimization Guide."

### Can I keep using Raindrop.io during migration?
Yes, but avoid making major changes during the migration process. Export your data first, then continue using Raindrop.io until you're comfortable with SaveIt.now.

### What about my browser bookmarks?
If you synced browser bookmarks to Raindrop.io, they'll be included in your export. SaveIt.now can enhance these with AI analysis too.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Export Problems
**Issue**: Backup creation fails
**Solution**: Try exporting smaller collections individually, or contact Raindrop.io support

**Issue**: Some URLs don't import properly
**Solution**: Check for malformed URLs in your CSV. SaveIt.now support can help with bulk corrections
