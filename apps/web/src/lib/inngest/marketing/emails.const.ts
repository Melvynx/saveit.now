  WELCOME_EMAIL: `Hi,

I'm Melvyn, the founder of SaveIt.now.

I built this app because I had over 500 bookmarks and I kept losing the good ones. Chrome bookmarks weren't helping, and Notion felt too heavy.

SaveIt.now is my solution ‚Äî a minimal, fast, and smart way to save and find links. It uses AI to summarize content, generate tags, take screenshots, and make everything searchable instantly.

This tool is something I use daily, and I'll keep improving it as long as I need it myself.

Here's how to get started:

1. Install the Extension:  
${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.extensions}

2. Open the app and save your first link:  
${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.app}

If you hit a problem or just want to share feedback, write me at help@saveit.now or DM me on Twitter: https://x.com/melvynxdev

Thanks for trying SaveIt.now.

  CHROME_EXTENSION_EMAIL: `Hi,

I'm Melvyn, the founder of SaveIt.now.

I noticed you haven't installed the Chrome extension yet. The extension is the fastest way to save bookmarks while browsing.

Here's why you should install it:

‚úÖ Save any page with one click
‚úÖ AI automatically generates tags and summaries
‚úÖ Works on any website
‚úÖ Syncs instantly with your SaveIt.now account

Install the Extension here:
${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.extensions}

Once installed, you can save bookmarks directly from any webpage. Just click the SaveIt.now icon in your browser toolbar.

Best,
Melvyn`,

  HOW_USE_CHROME_EXTENSION_EMAIL: `Hi,

The chrome extension lets you save images and bookmarks from any website.

For example, you find "Supabase UI" beautiful and want to save it, just click on the corner (make sure you pin the extension) to save the bookmark:

You can also right click on any website to save the page.

Finally, you can right click on any image to save it.

After the image is saved, you'll be able to search it because our AI analyzes the image and generates a description.

So... if you don't have the extension yet, download it here: ${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.extensions}

  HOW_TO_IMPORT_BOOKMARKS_EMAIL: `Hi,

You might have Chrome bookmarks or other tools bookmarks that you want to import.

For that you can just go to the import page: ${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.imports}

In this page, it's really simple...

You can drag and drop any file:

‚Ä¢ csv
‚Ä¢ html  
‚Ä¢ pdf

And we will extract the links for import. We don't support importing tags, text or anything else for our commitment to minimalism.

You can also just copy/paste any list of links into the input.

And that's it! üìã

The import can take a while... on average, it's 30 seconds per bookmark. If you import 20 bookmarks, it will take 10 minutes.

Best,
Melvyn`,

  HOW_TO_USE_BOOKMARKS_EMAIL: `Hi,

I see you're getting started with SaveIt.now! Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your bookmarks:

1. Save more than just links

Articles, videos, tweets, images, save anything valuable.

2. Save more than you think

Every time you find something valuable... even if you're not sure: save it.

You don't need to "cherry-pick" the best ones... just save everything.

Our system will help you find them later.

3. Do not organize

No need to organize, add notes, or tags. Our software is intelligent and will help you find them later.

Try saving a few more bookmarks and see how the AI helps organize them automatically.

Start saving: ${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.app}

  HOW_TO_SEARCH_BOOKMARKS_EMAIL: `Hi,

Now that you have some bookmarks saved, let me show you how to find them quickly:

üîç Smart Search

Type anything related to your bookmark - title, content, or tags. The AI understands context, so "React tutorial" will find React-related content.

Quick Filters

Filter by tags, dates, or bookmark types. Use the sidebar to browse by categories.

Advanced Search

Search within specific date ranges. Find bookmarks by domain or content type. Combine multiple filters for precise results.

Pro Tips

Use the search bar at the top of any page. Bookmark important searches for quick access. The more you save, the smarter the search becomes.

Try searching for something now: ${getServerUrl()}${APP_LINKS.app}

Melvyn`,
