Name : YouTube Read Feature
Context : Add the read fonctionnality to the YouTube type

---

For now, we have the "read" value only for ARTICLE type. After thinking, I also want it for the YOUTUBE type to know if we see or not a youtube video. Then we can use the SPECIAL filter (to add to the list)

$READ = only read content
$UNREAD = only unread content
$STAR = only stared content

This filter will work like the TAGS and like the TYPE of the content.

Create clean code for this filter using the beautiful logic we had before.
