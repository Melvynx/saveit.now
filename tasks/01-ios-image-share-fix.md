## 1. EXPLORATION PHASE ✅

### Pre-Exploration Planning

**Q1: What exactly am I looking for in this codebase?**
Answer: iOS app code that handles share intents, image processing endpoints, and image upload functionality

**Q2: What are the 3-5 key areas I need to understand?**

1. iOS app share intent handling code
2. Image upload endpoints and API routes
3. Image processing and storage logic
4. Share intent URL vs blob handling differences
5. Server-side image save functionality

### Parallel Agent Launch Checklist

- [x] **Codebase Explorer 1 Launched**: iOS app share intent code
- [x] **Codebase Explorer 2 Launched**: Image upload and processing API
- [x] **Codebase Explorer 3 Launched**: Share intent and image handling patterns
- [ ] **Web Research Agent Launched**: External documentation (if needed)

### Search Quality Check

- [x] All agents launched simultaneously in ONE message
- [x] Search terms are specific and targeted
- [x] Found relevant files for editing/reference
- [x] Identified existing patterns to follow

### Exploration Results Summary

**Key files found for editing**: 
- /apps/mobile/app/share-handler.tsx (lines 94-106) - Core issue location
- /apps/mobile/src/lib/api-client.ts (lines 99-118) - Needs FormData support
- /apps/web/app/api/v1/bookmarks/route.ts - API endpoint to enhance

**Example files to reference**: 
- /apps/web/app/api/user/avatar/route.ts - File upload pattern
- /apps/web/app/api/bookmarks/[bookmarkId]/upload-screenshot/route.ts - Bookmark image upload
- /apps/web/src/lib/aws-s3/aws-s3-upload-files.ts - S3 upload utilities

**Existing patterns discovered**: 
- File uploads use FormData with 2MB limit and specific MIME types
- S3 upload via uploadFileToS3() utility
- API routes use userRoute/apiRoute with Zod validation
- Background processing via Inngest for image analysis

**Dependencies/libraries used**: 
- expo-share-intent for iOS share handling
- @aws-sdk/client-s3 for S3 uploads
- Sharp for image processing
- next-zod-route for API validation

### Exploration Completion

- [x] All relevant files identified
- [x] Code patterns understood
- [x] Ready to proceed to planning phase

## 2. PLANNING PHASE ✅

### Implementation Strategy Questions

**Q3: What is the core functionality I need to implement?**
Answer: Fix iOS share intent to upload actual image blobs instead of treating local file paths as URLs. Need to: 1) Read image file data from local path in React Native 2) Send image as FormData to API 3) Handle image upload in API endpoint 4) Process and save to S3

**Q4: What existing patterns should I follow?**
Answer: Follow avatar upload pattern: FormData multipart upload, 2MB limit, specific MIME types (JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF), S3 upload via uploadFileToS3(), Zod validation, userRoute/apiRoute pattern, return S3 URL in response

**Q5: What files need to be modified vs created?**
Answer: MODIFY: share-handler.tsx (file reading), api-client.ts (FormData support), /api/v1/bookmarks/route.ts (accept files). NO NEW FILES - use existing S3 upload utilities and patterns

### Detailed Implementation Plan

**Core Changes Required:**

1. Update share-handler.tsx to read file data and send as FormData instead of treating path as URL
2. Enhance api-client.ts to support FormData uploads alongside JSON requests  
3. Modify /api/v1/bookmarks route to accept optional image file with existing bookmark creation
4. Use existing S3 upload pattern to store image and get URL
5. Ensure uploaded image triggers existing Inngest image processing pipeline

**Test Coverage Strategy:**
- [ ] **Tests to write**: None - modify existing functionality only
- [ ] **Tests to modify**: None - staying in scope
- [ ] **Test commands to run**: pnpm ts && pnpm lint in apps/web

**Documentation Updates:**
- [ ] **Files to update**: None required
- [ ] **New docs needed**: None required

### Plan Review and Approval

- [x] **Plan posted as GitHub comment** (if issue): ✓
- [x] **Plan is clear and specific**: ✓
- [x] **Scope is well-defined**: ✓
- [x] **User approval received**: [x] YES / [ ] PENDING

**Q6: Is anything unclear or missing from the plan?**
Answer: Plan is clear and comprehensive. Using existing patterns for file upload, staying strictly in scope, no new dependencies needed.

### Planning Completion

- [x] Implementation strategy finalized
- [x] All technical decisions made
- [x] Ready to proceed to coding phase
